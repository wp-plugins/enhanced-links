== Description ==

A plugin for wordpress which allows you to list your links in a sexier way. Very useful when you have a great number of links and categories. A sample use can be found on my [links page] (http://www.vincentprat.info/wordpress/wp-content/themes/vprat2/links.php).

This plugin is available under the GPL license, which means that it’s free. If you use it for a commercial web site, if you appreciate my efforts or if you want to encourage me to develop and maintain it, please consider making a donation using Paypal, a secured payment solution. You just need to click the button on the [plugin home page] (http://www.vincentprat.info/wordpress/2006/04/13/wordpress-plugin-enhanced-links/) and follow the instructions.

== Installation ==

Just install the plugin in the wordpress “wp-content/plugins/enhanced_links/” directory, activate it and insert some little code into the side bar:

`<li><h2>Links</h2>`
`<?php enh_links_show_enhanced_links(); ?>`
`</li>`

**Options**

By editing the plugin file, you will be able to customize a little bit the listing of the links, for example if you want to show an image instead of the », or if you want to show the link description or if you want to use the possibilities offered by scriptaculous effects allows to smoothly slide in and out the link blocks.
